  - This manor is haunted by ghosts, I need you to get rid of them
  - Bring their objects to them (The capsules are the ghosts, bring them objects
    of the same colour)
  - If an object is correct the ghost will dissapear
  - If the object is incorrect.....
  - Nothing will happen.         yet.
  - You can use tab to pause the game and see controls
